## ABOUT MYSELF

Objective: to get a position of Front-End developer.
Full-time, remote, ready for business trips, not ready to relocate.
I’d describe myself as a goal-oriented and hardworking person. I’ve been working as a lawyer all my career. Last year I decided to make a career shift because I was carried away with web-development. Life is unpredictable, it changes, so it is important to be flexible and get the skills that the future holds.
I have passion for this job. I like solving problems and seeing the result of my work.

## SKILLS

- HTML
- CSS (Framework Bootstrap, Preprocessor SCSS, BEM methodology).
- JavaScript (Fundamentals, Functional Programming, OOP, Asynchronous JavaScript, ES6+, DOM), JSON.
- Version control: Git (remote service GitHub).
- Module Bundlers: Gulp.
- Figma, Avocode (for web development).
- VSCode.

## CODE EXAMPLE

Disemvowel Trolls KATA from CODEWARS:
\_Trolls are attacking your comment section!
A common way to deal with this situation is to remove all of the vowels from the trolls' comments, neutralizing the threat.
Your task is to write a function that takes a string and return a new string with all vowels removed.
For example, the string "This website is for losers LOL!" would become "Ths wbst s fr lsrs LL!".
Note: for this kata y isn't considered a vowel.  
`function disemvowel(str)` {\
`let newStr = "",`\
`i;`

`for (i = 0; i < str.length; i++) {`\
`if ("aeiou".includes(str[i].toLowerCase())) continue;`\
`newStr += str[i];`\
`}`\
`return newStr;`\
```} `
